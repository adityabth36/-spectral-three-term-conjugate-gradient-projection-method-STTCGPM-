## Overview
This repository contains benchmark problems and application-driven test cases for evaluating **derivative-free, descent-based, and iterative algorithms** for solving **nonlinear equations and optimization problems**.  
The focus is on problems arising in **numerical analysis, optimisation**, under various structural assumptions.

## Folder Descriptions

### Standard_Equation
Contains classical nonlinear equation problems, typically assuming:
- Continuity
- weaker monotonicity

These problems are used as **baseline test cases** for convergence and performance evaluation.

---

### Weaker_Monotone_Equations
Includes nonlinear equations satisfying weaker conditions such as:
- Generalized monotonicity assumptions

---

### Decentralized_logistic_regression
Focuses on **decentralized / distributed logistic regression problems**, where:


---

### Image_restoration_problem
- Image deblurring


---

### Sparse_Signal_Recovery
Deals with sparse recovery and compressed sensing problems, such as:
- Sparse nonlinear equations
- ℓ₁-regularized models
- Signal reconstruction from limited measurements


---

## Notes
- Each folder contains its own `README.md` describing the specific problem formulation.
